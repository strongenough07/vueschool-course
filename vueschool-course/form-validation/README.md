This repository contains the example code for the [Vue.js Form Validation](https://vueschool.io/courses/vuejs-form-validation) Course.

This course will teach you how to be a Vue.js Form Validation Master.

Learn how to provide your users with a delightful experience when they fill out your forms by validating your forms with modern best-practices and by reporting specific error messages.

The course starts by going through how you would validate forms without any help from third-party libraries or plugins. Then we’ll dive into [vuelidate](https://monterail.github.io/vuelidate/#sub-package-content) and learn how to validate forms like a pro.

You’ll learn the difference between input states (dirty, invalid, error, touched, etc.) and how you can use them to validate your input fields when you want to. For instance. while a user is typing, after the user has left the input field or before the entire form is submitted.

The course also covers theory and best practices about validators responsibilities and asynchronous validation.

If you want to learn how you can put your new Vue.js Form skills to use in a real-world application, you can check out [The Vue.js Master Class](https://vueschool.io/the-vuejs-master-class)
